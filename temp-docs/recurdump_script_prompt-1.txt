Would you mind if we created a new python script named "rdump_ff-export.py" and we created / saved this script in the "scripts" directory of this project? If you would be ok with that, thank you for being willing to do that.

I think it would be best if we built this script step by step as opposed to all at once, if that works for you. 

The first step should be to have the script to have a required argument (with an argument flag) - this argument should be for the user to give a directory path or, if the user uses the "." character, the script should know that it should use the current working directory for the path.

When run, the script should export all of the bookmarks from the locally installed FireFox web browser and should save these bookmark to a the specified directory given by the required argument. When the script exports the bookmarks, it should save two versions of the bookmarks - a HTML and a JSON file.

There should be an optional argument (with an argument flag) where the user cand specify what the filenames for the two versions of the bookmarks being exported.

The script should be created in such a way that, if the user copies the script to a directory in the global environment variable (the "$PATH" variable) and the user runs the script from from a different directory, the script should function properly.

If the user uses the "--help" or "-h" argument flags, the script should prompt the user with a detailed explanation of what the script does and how to use it - this help information prompt should be detailed but not overly long or overly complicated. Lastly, if the user inputs incorrect arguments / information or not arguments at all, the script should present the user with this help information prompt.

I know this is a lot of work to ask you to do but I really appreciate your help so very much!
